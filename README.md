An interactive map with the conflict data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, the biggest conflict dataset that comprises more than 250000 conflict events. Through a dropdown menu, this app allows to filter the conflict data by the the conflict type, the conflict intensity, and the conflict location on a choropleth map.

Hovering countries on the map will show you aggregated individual statistics regarding number of conflict events and fatalities for each country. This interactive D3 map is based on a topojson file that provides a basic geographical layer for a global map with country-level data and a React-simple-maps library that provides a D3 global map and relevant features.

This is a project in-progress, with React and D3 as the tech stack. I am planning to add additional analytical features including graphs, barcharts, and other components of data analytics. This will help us better understand the intensity and dynamics of conflicts through the visualization of conflict data.
